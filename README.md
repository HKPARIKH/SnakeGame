This is a Snake game that used to come on old phones, especially if you remember it on Nokia phones. Something like this: -

This game was made by me using the Java Language.

I used Swing and AWT (abstract window tool) concepts to make this.

You can find two main files in Src/snakegame that have the coding part of the game and actions.

and the icons folder in this route SnakeGame/src/snakegame/icons that have the icons of head, body, and apple.




Thanks for your time :)
